⚠️ IMPORTANT: LOGO SETUP REQUIRED ⚠️

The website references a logo file at: /public/logo.png

STEPS TO ADD THE LOGO:

1. Download or save the Pollege logo (the transparent PNG with the chicken character and colorful text)

2. Place it in this exact location:
   /public/logo.png

3. Make sure the file is named exactly "logo.png" (lowercase)

4. The logo should be the transparent version (PNG format)

Without this file, the logo will not display correctly on the website.

The logo is used in:
- Navigation bar
- Hero section (main banner)
- Footer

Once added, the logo will have an orange glow effect that matches the website's color scheme.
